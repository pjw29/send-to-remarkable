# Send to reMarkable

A Cloudflare Worker service that lets you upload documents to your reMarkable tablet via email or web upload. A public version is hosted [under my domain](https://send-to-remarkable.zegs.me). Note that the administrator of the service (me in this case) technically has full access to your files if you enter your link code.

Most of the code in this repo was generated by AI, and vetted by me. The method for uploading was found by hand, and structure of the codebase was human-designed.

## Key Files

- `src/index.ts` - Main API routes and email handler
- `src/auth-do.ts` - Durable Object for authentication management
- `src/workflow.ts` - Workflow for reMarkable API uploads
- `src/upload-utils.ts` - Shared upload logic
- `assets/index.html` - Web interface

## Self-Hosting Setup

### Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account with Workers and R2 enabled
- Domain managed on Cloudflare

### 0. Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zegevlier/send-to-remarkable
npm i
```

### 1. Create R2 Bucket

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create send-to-remarkable-docs
```

### 2. Configure Email Routing

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard -> Your Domain -> Email](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/email/routing/overview)
2. Enable Email Routing
3. Enable catch all for the domain. We will point this to the worker later.

### 3. Deploy Worker

1. Update `wrangler.jsonc`:
   - Change `name` to your preferred worker name
   - Update the route pattern to the (sub)domain you want to use
   - Update R2 bucket name if different

1. Deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 4. Connect Email Routing

1. After deployment, go back to Email Routing settings
2. Select your deployed worker as the destination for the catch-all rule
3. Save the configuration

## Usage

Now you can visit the (sub)domain you configured earlier and start using it! If you do not want other people signing up to the web interface, I recommend either putting the page behind Cloudflare Access or disabling the web route after signing up yourself.
